# Java-Code
A basic java code about conditional statements
Hello all I am aniket, and this is the begining of my github journey i will be creating and adding much more codes about other programming languages as we progress i will be also be uploading my codes/work/projects of my upcoming work as well. So be sure to stay up do date. 

The following code that i have uploaded is really a basic java code, about conditional statements, just for reference, so make sure to go through it.
Also make sure you have vscode or any other compatible IDE installed in order to view this code. In case you dont, you can actually open this up with notepad well.

In order to run this code (if you have vscode then just download the extension) make sure java complier JDK which is Java Development Kit lates version installed. I have put down a link to download the compiler for java:

These are some of the links you can use to downlaod JDK, so choose your version and install, In case the links dont work here just copy the link in the browser tab to open it. I have also put the website link below so that you can explore more: 

Link for JDK website : https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/
If the website link above does not work too, then copy and paste this link in your browseer tab too.
